# pfica: Penalized Independent Component Analysis for Functional Data
## Install the Package
If you have **R** on your computer, downloading the `pfica` Package is a very easy task. Before downloading it, as it is a beta version no yet published on CRAN, you should have installed `devtools` and load it:

```R
R> install.packages("devtools")
R> library("devtools")
```

After that, to download, you can type in the **R** prompt:

```R
R> install_github("m-vidal/pfica")
```
You will get a message confirming that your `pfica` Package has been installed correctly.

This is a version in development of `pfica` Package. 
`pfica` was created as a result of the master thesis:  
Vidal, M. (2020). “Functional Independent Component Analysis in Bioelectrical Signal Processing”. MA thesis. Universidad de Granada.
supervised by AM. Aguilera and M. Escabias.
