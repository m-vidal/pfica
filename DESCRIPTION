Description: This package includes a set of tools to perform smoothed (and non-smoothed) 
  principal/independent components analysis of functional data. Various functional 
  pre-whitening approaches are implemented as discussed in Vidal and Aguilera (2022) 
  “Novel whitening approaches in functional settings", <doi:10.1002/sta4.516>. Further whitening 
  representations of functional data can be derived in terms of a few principal components, 
  providing a powerful avenue to explore hidden structures in low dimensional settings: 
  see Vidal, Rosso and Aguilera (2021) “Bi-smoothed functional independent 
  component analysis for EEG artifact removal”, <doi:10.3390/math9111243>.
