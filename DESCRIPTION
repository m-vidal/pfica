Title: Independent Components Analysis Techniques for Functional Data
Author: Marc Vidal [aut, cre], Ana Mª Aguilera [aut, ths]
Maintainer: Marc Vidal <marc.vidalbadia@ugent.be>
Description: This package includes a set of tools to perform smoothed (and non-smoothed) 
  principal/independent components analysis of functional data. Various functional 
  pre-whitening approaches discussed in Vidal, M., Aguilera, A.M. (2022) 
  “Novel whitening approaches in functional settings", <doi:10.1002/sta4.516>
  are implemented. Further, whitening representations of functional data can be derived 
  in terms of a few principal components providing a powerful way to find hidden structures 
  in low dimensional settings: see Vidal, M., Rosso, M., Aguilera, A.M. (2021) “Bi-smoothed functional independent component analysis for EEG artifact removal” <doi:doi:10.3390/math9111243>.
